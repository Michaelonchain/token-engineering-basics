This repo demonstrates how I design and analyze token supply for early-stage Web3 projects.
# token-engineering-basics
A clear and practical introduction to token engineering, tokenomics design, simulation, and crypto-economic analysis for new and growing Web3 projects.
## Work in Progress

This repository documents ongoing research into
token supply, inflation modeling, and incentive design.

Updates are added incrementally as assumptions,
models, and observations evolve.
## Overview

This repository documents my ongoing research into tokenomics
and incentive design for Web3 projects.

The focus is on understanding how supply, inflation, emissions,
and incentives affect long-term sustainability.

This work is research-driven and evolves over time.
